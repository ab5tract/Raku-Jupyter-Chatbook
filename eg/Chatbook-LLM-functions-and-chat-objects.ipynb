       "To make the original word from the characters in the previous example, you can use the `join` method. The `join` method takes a list of characters and returns a string that contains all the characters in the list, joined together with the specified separator. For example, if you have a list of characters called `@characters` that contains the characters `'H'`, `'e'`, `'l'`, `'l'`, `'o'`, `','`, `' '`, `'w'`, `'o'`, `'r'`, `'l'`, `'d'`, `'!'`, you can use the `join` method to join the characters together with the space character to get the original string:\n",

       "```\n",
       "say \" \".join @characters;\n",

       "This will print the following output:\n",
       "\n",
       "```\n",
       "Hello, world!\n",
