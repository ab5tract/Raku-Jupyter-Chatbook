# Jupyter::Chatbook

## In brief

This Raku package is a fork of Brian Duggan's 
["Jupyter::Kernel"](https://github.com/bduggan/raku-jupyter-kernel).

"Jupyter::Kernel" is a pure Raku implementation of a Raku kernel for Jupyter clients¹.

Jupyter notebooks provide a web-based (or console-based)
Read Eval Print Loop (REPL) for running code and serializing input and output.

It is desirable to include the interaction with Large Language Models (LLMs) to the "usual" REPL.

Having LLM-aware and LLM-chat-endowed notebooks (i.e. *chatbooks*) can really speed up the:
- Utilization of Raku 
  - Derivation of useful (actionable) code
- Adoption of Raku by newcomers
- Writing and preparation of documents on variety of subjects

This repository is mostly for experimental work, but it aims to be *always* very
useful for interacting with LLMs via Raku.

**Remark:** The reason to have a separate package -- a fork of
["Jupyter::Kernel"](https://github.com/bduggan/raku-jupyter-kernel) --
is because:
- I plan to introduce 4-6 new package dependencies
- I expect to do a fair amount of UX experimental implementations and refactoring

**Remark:** I am convinced that by using "Jupyter::Kernel" as a base some fairly sophisticated, 
yet natural programming workflows can be produced.


-------

## Installation and setup

Follow the instructions of
["Jupyter::Kernel"](https://github.com/bduggan/raku-jupyter-kernel).

-------

## Using LLMs in chatbooks

There are four ways to use LLMs in a chatbook:

1. LLM functions, [AA3, AAp4]
2. Chat objects, [AAp4]
3. OpenAI, [AAp2], or PaLM, [AAp3] code cells with magics
4. Sequential composition of chat cells

Let us briefly describe each way in turn.

## Alternative Raku Literate programming solutions

### Computational Markdown documents

The Raku package
["Text::CodeProcessing"](https://raku.land/zef%3Aantononcube/Text%3A%3ACodeProcessing)
can be used to do 
[Literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming)
with Raku; see [AA1, AAv1].

"Text::CodeProcessing" works with Markdown, Org-mode, and Pod6 files.

Here is typical workflow:

1. One can use a Markdown editor (
[Visual Studio Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Code) / 
[Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) / 
[CommaIDE](https://commaide.com) / 
[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) / 
[One Markdown](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/one-markdown/id1507139439)) 
to write a "work" Markdown document. 

2. That Markdown file can be "executed" using "Text::CodeProcessing". 

3. The obtained, "woven" Markdown file has the results of 
the Raku, Shell, OpenAI, and PaLM code cells in the original document.

4. The content of the "work" document can be refined based in the results displayed in
the "woven" document.

5. If a "more intensive interaction" is needed one of the Markdown files can be converted into a notebook:
   - ["Markdown::Grammar"](https://raku.land/zef:antononcube/Markdown::Grammar), [AAp3], can convert to Mathematica notebooks.
   - ["jupytext"](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/) can convert to Jupyter notebooks.

See the demo recording
["Raku Literate Programming via command line pipelines"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UjAdQaKof8), [AAv1], (4.5 min.)

**LLM usage:** Markdown cells with messages to be send to OpenAI or PaLM can be specified.
See [AA2, AA3].

### Mathematica notebooks

The creation of Jupyter notebooks was inspired from
[Mathematica's](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/?source=nav)
notebooks. (Jupyter, instead of S-expressions uses JSON format.)

So, instead of using Jupyter's framework for having a *Raku notebook solution*, 
the much more mature framework of Mathematica can be used. See: 

- The Raku package ["Text::CodeProcessing"](https://raku.land/zef%3Aantononcube/Text%3A%3ACodeProcessing), [AAp1]
- The WL paclet ["RakuMode"](https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PacletRepository/resources/AntonAntonov/RakuMode/), [AAp2]

See the demo recordings:
- ["Racoons playing with pearls and onions"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlkoNZK8MpU), [AAv2]
- ["Streamlining ChatGPT code generation and narration workflows (Raku)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI-oWLz5dYY), [AAv2]

## Motivation extended 

*(... or just a rant...)*

One of my "missions" with Raku is to have a reasonable set of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms implemented (only) with Raku.
Another "mission" is to endow Raku with a Large Language Models (LLMs) system that integrates very well with Raku and Raku's ecosystem.
Having "simple" ML algorithms, integrated LLMs interaction,
and Raku's text processing abilities should produce a very attractive system for doing science and mathematics.
(At least to a point.)

When Raku is "not enough" I am trying to use natural Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) to generate executable code to other programming languages and their ecosystems.
I mostly target Mathematica, R, and Python. (In that order of priority.)
(The DSLs parsers-interpreters are, of course, written in Raku.)

I think the main and most challenging Raku deficiencies for doing science and mathematics are not having:
1. Robust, interactive "notebook solution"
2. Easy to invoke and use graphics system

There are half a dozen efforts for point 1: "Jupyter::Kernel", "Text::CodeProcessing" and "RakuMode", VSCode LSP, Emacs-mode, and maybe others.

I do not consider "Jupyter::Kernel" and "RakuMode" reliable.
For point 2 -- there are a few graphics solutions for Raku. In my opinion none of them:
- Is easy to install and invoke
- And is easy to use
- And produces pretty, tunable, useful graphics

The last point strongly depends upon having a robust interactive notebook solution.
